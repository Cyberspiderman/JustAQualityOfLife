So this has been in the works since we first released our mod in 2020. Yeah it's been a while, but first I would like to thank our new sprites Stab_Person who helped us inmprove some sprites.

As stated previously this is our first mod and because of that please expect that things might now work right or that things might not have the best textures.

Lastly before the content of the update we have rewritten every item so any worlds with our items previously will not contain the items of the mod now.
